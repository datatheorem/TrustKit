/**
 A boolean. If set to `YES`, TrustKit will perform method swizzling on the App's `NSURLConnection` and `NSURLSession` delegates in order to automatically add SSL pinning validation to the App's connections.
 
 Swizzling allows enabling pinning within an App without having to find and modify each and every instance of `NSURLConnection` or `NSURLSession` delegates.
 However, it should only be enabled for simple Apps, as it may not work properly in several scenarios including:
 
 * Apps with complex connection delegates, for example to handle client authentication via certificates or basic authentication.
 * Apps where method swizzling of the connection delegates is already performed by another module or library (such as Analytics SDKs).
 * Apps that do no use `NSURLSession` or `NSURLConnection` for their connections.
 
 In such scenarios or if the developer wants a tigher control on the App's networking behavior, `kTSKSwizzleNetworkDelegates` should be set to `NO`; the developer should then manually add pinning validation to the App's authentication handlers.
 
 See the `TSKPinningValidator` class for instructions on how to do so.

/**
 `TrustKit` is a class for programmatically configuring the global SSL pinning policy within an App.
 
  The policy can be set either by adding it to the App's _Info.plist_ under the `TSKConfiguration` key, or by programmatically supplying it using the `TrustKit` class described here. Throughout the App's lifecycle, TrustKit can only be initialized once so only one of the two techniques should be used.
 
 A TrustKit pinning policy is a dictionary which contains some global, App-wide settings (of type `TSKGlobalConfigurationKey`) as well as domain-specific configuration keys (of type `TSKDomainConfigurationKey`) to be defined under the `kTSKPinnedDomains` entry. The following table shows the keys and the types of the corresponding values, and uses indentation to indicate structure:
 
 ```
 | Key                                          | Type       |
 |----------------------------------------------|------------|
 | TSKSwizzleNetworkDelegates                   | Boolean    |
 | TSKIgnorePinningForUserDefinedTrustAnchors   | Boolean    |
 | TSKPinnedDomains                             | Dictionary |
 | __ <domain-name-to-pin-as-string>            | Dictionary |
 | ____ TSKPublicKeyHashes                      | Array      |
 | ____ TSKPublicKeyAlgorithms                  | Array      |
 | ____ TSKIncludeSubdomains                    | Boolean    |
 | ____ TSKExcludeSubdomainFromParentPolicy     | Boolean    |
 | ____ TSKEnforcePinning                       | Boolean    |
 | ____ TSKReportUris                           | Array      |
 | ____ TSKDisableDefaultReportUri              | Boolean    |
 ```
 
 When setting the pinning policy programmatically, it has to be supplied to the `initializeWithConfiguration:` method as a dictionary. For example:
 
 ```
    NSDictionary *trustKitConfig =
  @{
    kTSKSwizzleNetworkDelegates: @NO,
    kTSKPinnedDomains : @{
            @"www.datatheorem.com" : @{
                    kTSKExpirationDate: @"2017-12-01",
                    kTSKPublicKeyAlgorithms : @[kTSKAlgorithmRsa2048],
                    kTSKPublicKeyHashes : @[
                            @"HXXQgxueCIU5TTLHob/bPbwcKOKw6DkfsTWYHbxbqTY=",
                            @"0SDf3cRToyZJaMsoS17oF72VMavLxj/N7WBNasNuiR8="
                            ],
                    kTSKEnforcePinning : @NO,
                    kTSKReportUris : @[@"http://report.datatheorem.com/log_report"],
                    },
            @"yahoo.com" : @{
                    kTSKPublicKeyAlgorithms : @[kTSKAlgorithmRsa4096],
                    kTSKPublicKeyHashes : @[
                            @"TQEtdMbmwFgYUifM4LDF+xgEtd0z69mPGmkp014d6ZY=",
                            @"rFjc3wG7lTZe43zeYTvPq8k4xdDEutCmIhI5dn4oCeE=",
                            ],
                    kTSKIncludeSubdomains : @YES
                    }
            }};
    
    [TrustKit initializeWithConfiguration:trustKitConfig];
 ```
 
 Similarly, TrustKit can be initialized in Swift:
 
 ```
        let trustKitConfig = [
            kTSKSwizzleNetworkDelegates: false,
            kTSKPinnedDomains: [
                "yahoo.com": [
                    kTSKExpirationDate: "2017-12-01",
                    kTSKPublicKeyAlgorithms: [kTSKAlgorithmRsa2048],
                    kTSKPublicKeyHashes: [
                        "JbQbUG5JMJUoI6brnx0x3vZF6jilxsapbXGVfjhN8Fg=",
                        "WoiWRyIOVNa9ihaBciRSC7XHjliYS9VwUGOIud4PB18="
                    ],]]] as [String : Any]
        
        TrustKit.initialize(withConfiguration:trustKitConfig)
 ```
 
 The various configuration keys that can be specified in the policy are described in the "Constants" section of the documentation.
 
 Lastly, once TrustKit has been initialized, `kTSKValidationCompletedNotification` notifications will be posted every time TrustKit validates the certificate chain of a server; these notifications provide some information about the validation that was done and can be used for example for performance measurement.
